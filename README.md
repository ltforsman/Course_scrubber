### Welcome to my Course_Scrubber Project :octocat:

This is a summer personal project to learn and hone coding skills. The project is a simple tool to help Cornell students by finding a schedule that fits all the classes they want to take. The usable tool can be found in 2 ways:

1. **Heroku app**: 
    The link to the app is https://cu-schedule.herokuapp.com/. It may take a minute or two to load when first opening just due to Heroku's servers.

2. **Run locally**:
    You can download the source code from this github repo if you would like to run the software locally. To run, with python 3, run the local.py file and a separate window will popup. 

    To get the required libraries to run the source code use the line `pip install -r requirements.txt`. I recommend using a virtual environment in the project directory, but simply installing the dependancies to your local computer works as well.

These two methods use the same algorithm and differ only in the presentation.

Some features that I would like to add include:
- [ ] cleaner display of the resulting schedule 
- [ ] the ability to chose times when you do not want to have class
- [ ] better handling of when no schedule can be found
- [ ] displaying which sections had conflict
